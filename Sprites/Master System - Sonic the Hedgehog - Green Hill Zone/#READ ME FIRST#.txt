SONIC 1 SMS/GG LEVEL RIP
------------------------

1) CREDITS
The tilesets contained within were originally created by SEGA 
and Ancient.  The rip was created via an automated process by 
Techokami, with information from Sonic Retro and the emulator
MEKA to create the tilesheets.

If you use the contents of this package, you must give credit
to SEGA, Ancient, and Techokami.

If you did not download this tileset from the following domains:

then you should immediately start yelling at the webmaster for
mirroring this file without permission.
PROTIP: If you ask first, I'll almost always say yes!

2) THE RIPPING PROCESS
The graphics are stored in an unconventional and rather bizzare
compression scheme, so I opted to manually create tilesheets
of all the 8x8 tiles used in a level.  The metatile data in the
ROM, however, is not compressed, which made things a lot easier
for me.

The source code to the script can be found here:

3) EXPLANATION OF TILESET
The most difficult aspect of making this rip is taking into
account the rotating palletes, which make the level seem vibrant
and animated.  To that end I made different tilesheets for each
pallete variation.  Creates a lot of redundant tiles, but at
least it gets the job done.

I know I didn't get all the animations for the rings.  That will
be on an objects sheet I plan to make in the near future.

The Master System and Game Gear don't have very many layers to
work with, so the background and foreground are merged together.
In other words, the background is included in this set.
